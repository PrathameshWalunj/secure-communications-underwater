# Secure Underwater Communications

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure communication system designed for submarine operations. It addresses critical vulnerabilities in existing underwater communication systems by implementing advanced cryptographic techniques, covert channels, and quantum-resistant algorithms. The system aims to provide undetectable, highly secure data transmission in challenging underwater environments.

## Features

### Quantum-Resistant Encryption
- Implementation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- Future-proofing against potential quantum computing threats

### Covert Channel Communication
- Techniques to hide communication within ambient ocean noise
- Steganographic methods for data concealment

### Fractured Transmission Protocol
- Message splitting into encrypted fragments
- Randomized transmission of fragments to enhance security

### Adaptive Frequency Hopping
- Dynamic frequency selection based on environmental conditions
- Evasion techniques against jamming attempts

### Zero-Knowledge Authentication
- Advanced authentication mechanisms
- Identity verification without revealing sensitive information
