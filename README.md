## Project Overview

SecureComms is a project focused on developing and evaluating robust encryption and security mechanisms specifically designed for underwater acoustic communication systems. It addresses the unique challenges of secure data transmission in underwater environments, mitigating potential cyber threats such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and denial-of-service attacks.

The project explores various encryption algorithms, key exchange protocols, authentication methods, and integrity protection techniques optimized for the constraints of underwater channels. Through simulations and modeling of the underwater acoustic channel, taking into account factors like multipath propagation, Doppler spread, and ambient noise, the project evaluates the performance, resilience, and robustness of the implemented security mechanisms.
